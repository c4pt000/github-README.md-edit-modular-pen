# when pen is activated to edit a readme.md file type or a file that supports ![s1] image
# there should be a mouse hover to add an image as your scroll down the README.md editing it
# when clicked an image file can be uploaded to the repo main directory in the background or a designated "images" folder so that exact spot in the readme can have # the file posted as a type of [s1] block 

# the uploader will also prompt for a size indicator (800x600) etc and or http url link type options
 
# to post the image as an ![s1] type block exactly at that location in the readme
